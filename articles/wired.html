	  <h2><u>The Wired</u></h2>
	  <h2 style="font-size: 13px;">Oct. 26, 2021</h2>
	  <p>
	  My fascination with the "Wired" and "CyberWorld". lead me to think in my early teen years.
	  I thought to myself, what if we can transfer our consciousness temporarily or permanently 
	  on the internet, a game, or a computer. It would be a wonderful feeling to be fully immersed 
	  in your favorite game, hang out with your friends that are far away, do random things without 
	  consequences, even old people can feel young inside this world that we can customize and control. 
	  But it won't be perfect, it will have many risks, but still, I wish I'm still alive to experience this.
	  <br/><br/>
	  I was highly influenced by the movie Matrix, where it states that we are already living inside virtual 
	  reality or the simulation. Is this world really real? What if we are not creators, but creations.

	  The simulation hypothesis is a proposal regarding the nature of existence which posits that all of 
	  existence is an artificial simulation, such as a computer simulation. Some versions rely on the development 
	  of a simulated reality, a proposed technology that would be able to convince its inhabitants that the simulation 
	  was "real". There is a really good video explaining Simulation theory, you should check this out.

	  Some disappearances are so improbable that they seemingly defy the rules of our reality. In cases like these, 
	  some believe that glitches within our reality were to blame. A glitch that caused them to be removed from our reality.

	  Some anime tried to use this premise like Swort Art Online, Log Horizon and Accel World, but of all the anime I watched only
	  Serial Experiments Lain has got the grasp of what I'm fininding. Serial Experiments Lain, questions a lot of things like
	  "do we really exist", "what is existance", "is there really a god", and etc. In SEL the wired and reality can cross each other.
